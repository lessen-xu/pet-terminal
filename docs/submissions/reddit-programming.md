**Title:**

```
I built a virtual pet that lives in your terminal and earns rewards when you make Git commits
```

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a fun side project that I thought you might enjoy: **Pet Terminal** - a virtual pet that lives in your command line.

The idea is simple: your pet lives in your project directory and grows happier when you code. Every time you make a Git commit, your pet automatically earns coins, XP, and stat bonuses.

**Key Features:**

- **Git Integration** - Your pet loves watching you work! Just run `pet git` after coding to collect rewards
- **6 Pet Species** - Cat, Dog, Rabbit, Hamster, Bird, or Dragon (each with unique ASCII art)
- **Lenient Design** - Stats decay slowly, so your pet stays healthy for days without attention
- **Shop System** - Buy food, toys, and supplies with earned coins
- **Level System** - Watch your pet grow stronger as you care for it
- **One-Click Care** - Busy? Just run `pet care` to handle everything

**Quick Start:**

```bash
npm install -g pet-terminal
pet init          # Create your pet
pet status        # Check on your pet
```

**Philosophy:**

I designed this as a "zero-burden" companion. Unlike Tamagotchi, this isn't meant to be another chore - your pet gains stats automatically when you work. It's meant to make coding sessions more enjoyable, not stressful.
