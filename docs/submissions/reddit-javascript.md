**Title:**

```
Showcase: Pet Terminal - A CLI virtual pet that earns rewards when you make Git commits
```

**Body:**

Hi r/javascript!

I just published v1.0.0 of **Pet Terminal** - a Node.js CLI tool that adds a virtual pet companion to your terminal workflow.

**The Concept:**

Your pet lives in your project directory and grows happier when you code. When you make Git commits, your pet automatically earns:
- Coins (to spend in the shop)
- XP (to level up)
- Stat bonuses (hunger +15, happiness +10)

**Tech Stack:**

- TypeScript
- Commander.js (CLI framework)
- Chalk (terminal styling)
- Inquirer (interactive prompts)
- lowdb (JSON database)

**Features:**

```bash
pet init          # Create your pet (6 species available)
pet status        # View your pet's status with ASCII art
pet git           # Check for commits and earn rewards
pet care          # One-click care for all pet needs
pet shop          # Buy food, toys, medicine
```

**Why I built it:**

I wanted something fun in my terminal that wouldn't feel like a burden. The key insight was integrating with Git - something developers already do constantly. Your pet essentially "spectates" your coding sessions and gets excited when you commit code.

**Installation:**

```bash
npm install -g pet-terminal
```
